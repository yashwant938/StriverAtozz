# StriverAtozz Challenge

Welcome to the StriverAtozz 100 Days Challenge! This repository contains a collection of programming problems and solutions covered in the A to Z series by Striver.

## About the Challenge

The StriverAtozz challenge is a 100-day challenge where I'll be solving various programming problems and documenting them in this repository. The goal is to improve my coding skills, algorithms understanding, and problem-solving abilities.

## Folder Structure

- Each day's solutions are organized in a separate folder named `Day-X`, where X represents the day number.
- Inside each `Day-X` folder, you'll find the solutions for the problems covered on that day.
- The solutions are written in various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, etc.

## Getting Started

To navigate through the solutions, simply browse through the folders corresponding to each day. You can find the problem statements, code solutions, and any related resources within these folders.

## Progress

I'll be updating this repository daily with new solutions. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback or suggestions if you come across any improvements.

## Contact
